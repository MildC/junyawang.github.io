			<h1>about me.</h1>
				
			<p>
			Hi, my name is Junya Wang and I am a senior international student in <a href="http://www.siat.sfu.ca/">School of Interactive Arts and Technology (SIAT)</a> at <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/">Simon Fraser University</a>. SIAT is an interdisciplinary future-focused school for technologists, artists and designers to learn about interactive design, incorporating aesthetics with technical skills. Studying in SIAT provides me an opportunity to go through various project work, gain experience mainly in graphic, interface and interaction design.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			Being professional on designing, programming and applying design theories simutaneously, I can be a combination of graphic, interface and interaction designer. Being creative, having a strong sense of color and taste on style, I am good at designing and uniting the style of project. Being patient, responsible and good at precision, even details of the project needed to be done fastidiously. With strong technical skills, comprehension and organization skill, I can help the team solve problems efficiently.
			</p>
			
			<h2>enthusiasms</h2>
			<p>I currently live in Vancouver, Canada. In my spare time I enjoy listening to New Age, Classical music and original soundtracks, playing piano and violin, reading novels and interesting books with a cup of Chinese tea, watching a good movie, swimming and cooking.</p>

			<h3>photography</h3>
			<p>I have 3 years experience taking photos with both film and digital cameras, usually focus on landscapes, animals, portrait, street photography and documentary photography. My friends and I have set up the <a href="http://www.vanphoto.org/">Vancouver Outdoor Photography (VOP)</a> Club in 2012 and we have organized several events like photo contest, photo tour and field trip. Besides a designer, I am glad to work as a photographyer as well. </p>

			<h3>drawing and painting</h3>
			<p>I love the feeling of turning a sheet of blank paper into a gorgeous picture. Altough I haven't receive any formal training, with more than 10 years experience of drawing and painting, I could do both by hand and on PC.</p>

			<h3>handcrafts</h3>
			<p>Turing something useless or wasted to exquisite handcrafts is like giving the materials new lifes. I have been carving rubber stamps since 2011. I also enjoy DIY and making models. Handcrafts helped me to enjoy life more and learn to be more calm and patient.</p>
